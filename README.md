This was a project for Drexel's Engr 102, part of the Freshman design 
sequence.  At the time, all Drexel freshmen were required to complete 
this project.  [A description of the objective can be found here.](http://core.coe.drexel.edu/ay1213/sites/default/files/ENGR102_robot_overview_0.pdf)

While I'm rather proud of the system design, it was not as fully 
developed as it should have been.  Most of the competing designs
involved a robot that would wander about until it found a canister,
and then would literally follow the light to take it to the goal.  
My design, on the other hand, applied a coordinate-based navegation 
system to the field, allowing it to go directly to known canister 
locations and then take them directly to both goals. 


Note: I took this course in Winter 2012.  I did not originally put the
code into git, and when I put it in a repo, I made the timestamps about 
a year later than they should have been.  Oops.
